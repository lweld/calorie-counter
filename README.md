# Calculate Calories Consumed

I've been looking into front-end web development. Here's a 1-page webapp that calculates your total calories consumed after selecting various types of food.

After downloading this repo to a new folder, generate a [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server#lite-server) by:
1. Open command line, cd to your new folder
2. `npm init -y` to initialize an empty project
3. `npm install --save-dev lite-server` to install the lite-serve package
4. In the package.json file, change the content of "scripts" to the following: `"start": "lite-server"`
5. `npm start` to play with the webapp
